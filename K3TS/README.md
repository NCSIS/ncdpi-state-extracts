# Teaching Strategies scripts for Infinite Campus

These are largely based on the original scripts from our old system. Notable points...
- In the Teaching Strategies system, a student can only be associated with __one__ class. If a student is enrolled in both ELA and ELA DL/I, the script will only list them in ELA.
- Teaching Stragies is a "delta" sync. Data is not removed in Teaching Strategies. If a PSU changes their active scheduling trial in Infinite Campus, this may cause the sectionIDs at the State Edition level to change. This can result in users seeing duplicate empty classes in Teaching Strategies.
- Email addresses are _required_ .
