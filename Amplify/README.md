# Amplify mCLASS Scripts for Infinite Campus

These are largely based on the original scripts from our old system with a few minor updates.

Notably...
- 4th grade students with an "RRET" flag will still appear as 4th graders. An additional flag to indicate RRET status has been added to ensure the correct test is assigned.
- Rostering for K-3 ELA and ELA DL/I classes is enabled statewide by default.
- Rostering for 4th or 5th grade ELA classes is enabled selectively by school code based on requests from the NCDPI Office of Early Learning.
    - Rostering for 4th or 5th grade ELA DL/I classes is enabled as a pilot for one PSU.
- Rostering for other Amplify products or for grade levels beyond K-5 is __not__ supported by this process. Please contact Amplify for additional rostering options.

## Notes on SSO
These scripts provide rostering _only_. They have nothing to do with Amplify icon visibility in NCEdCloud.

The icon in NCEdCloud is enabled for all employees statewide as well as all K-3 students statewide. To enable it for additional grade levels, an NCEdCloud Administrator should [submit a request in the system](https://docs.ncedcloud.org/docs/amplify-addition-grades-opt-in).
